A hobby project made in Angular(typescript) and the Ionic framework. 

The application fetches data from the offical TMDB Api and presents the information to the user.

The News section is actual news scraped from a website using a node.js service. It is not part of the TMDB Api. You can find it under the MovieNode folder listed here.

The user can add/remove movies and series to his favorites. This data is stored in the localstorage on the device.

You can try out the application here: http://moviefinder-app.surge.sh/

PLEASE NOTE! 

The application is not targeted for desktop use but rather for mobile devices.
